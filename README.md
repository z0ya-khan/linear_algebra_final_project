MATH2015: Linear Algebra and Probability, Dr. Evan Sorenson (Fall 2024)

Group project with Jessie Wang and Ainsli Shah. Implemented k-means clustering in Python to analyze satellite imagery of oil spills: preprocessing and reshaping image data, feature selection (RGB space, grayscale, engineered features), iterative k-means optimization using Euclidean distance, evaluation of segmentation quality under different choices of k, and analysis of stability and limitations of k-means on dynamic, noisy datasets (e.g., satellite images with environmental variability).
